This is the take home project for auto books, this is an activity time tracker, that is not properly styled.

A user can enter an activity and and view the activity in the table. The user can also end the actitivty. 

The duration is updated every second. With a final time stamp once the activity has been cleared.

I typically use redux with the ducks pattern.

However, I decided not to here, because I could achieve full functionality with hooks.

I would like to add cypress automated tests, and potentially unit tests, but decided against it in favor of time.
